 What is Software Engineering?
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the development, maintenance, and testing of software. It ensures software is reliable, scalable, and efficient while meeting user requirements. Software engineering is crucial in the technology industry because it enables the creation of robust applications, supports innovation, and ensures software systems function correctly and securely in various environments.

 Key Milestones in the Evolution of Software Engineering
1950s-1960s: Birth of Software Engineering** - The term "software engineering" was introduced to address the "software crisis," highlighting the need for structured approaches to software development.
2.1970s-1980s: Emergence of Structured Programming** - The adoption of methodologies such as structured programming (e.g., using modularization) helped improve code maintainability.
3.2000s-Present: Agile and DevOps** - Agile methodologies and DevOps practices have revolutionized software development by enabling iterative development, continuous integration, and rapid deployment.

 Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
1.Planning - Define project scope and objectives.
2. Requirement Analysis - Gather and document user requirements.
3. Design - Develop system architecture and design specifications.
4. Implementation - Write and integrate code.
5. Testing - Identify and fix defects.
6. Deployment - Release the software to users.
7. Maintenance - Provide ongoing support and updates.

Comparison of Waterfall and Agile Methodologies
- Waterfall: A sequential approach where each phase must be completed before moving to the next.
   Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements, such as banking software.
- Agile: An iterative approach with continuous feedback and development cycles.
   Best for dynamic projects, such as mobile app development where user feedback is critical.

 Roles in a Software Engineering Team
- Software Developer: Writes, tests, and maintains code.
- Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality through testing.
- Project Manager: Oversees project scope, timeline, and resources.

Importance of IDEs and VCS in Software Development
- IDEs (Integrated Development Environments): Provide tools for coding, debugging, and testing (e.g., Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA).
- VCS (Version Control Systems): Track changes and manage collaboration (e.g., Git, Subversion).

 Common Challenges in Software Engineering and Solutions
1. Managing Complexity - Use modular design principles.
2. Meeting Deadlines - Adopt Agile methodologies.
3. Bug Management - Implement rigorous testing and debugging.

Types of Software Testing
1. Unit Testing - Tests individual components.
2. Integration Testing - Ensures different modules work together.
3. System Testing - Validates the complete system.
4. Acceptance Testing - Confirms the software meets business requirements.

Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

What is Prompt Engineering?
Prompt engineering is the process of designing inputs to effectively communicate with AI models. It helps generate accurate, relevant, and high-quality responses.

Example of Improving a Prompt
- Vague Prompt: "Tell me about history."
- Improved Prompt: "Provide a summary of the causes and effects of World War II."
- Why is it Better? It is specific, clear, and directs the AI toward a particular topic, ensuring a more relevant response.
